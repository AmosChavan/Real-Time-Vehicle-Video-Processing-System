# Real-Time-Vehicle-Video-Processing-System
This project implements a comprehensive real-time video processing system designed for detecting critical elements in traffic environments. Using advanced computer vision algorithms, the system can identify:

## Lane Markings: 
Accurate lane detection ensures the vehicle's path is clearly defined.
## Stop Signs and Traffic Signals: 
Recognition of stop signs and traffic lights for traffic compliance.
## Pedestrians: 
Real-time identification of pedestrians to enhance safety and avoid collisions.

# Features
## Real-Time Detection: 
Efficient and high-speed processing suitable for real-world applications.
## Optimized Algorithms: 
Leverages various computer vision techniques for precision and performance.
## Multi-Object Detection: 
Capable of handling multiple detection tasks simultaneously.

# Technology Stack
OpenCV for video processing and feature detection

Machine Learning Models for object detection

# How It Works
The system processes each frame from the video feed and uses object detection models to identify key features like lanes, signs, and pedestrians. The detected elements are then marked on the video output, providing an intuitive and clear representation of the surroundings.

C++ as the primary programming language for code flexibility and performance

# Installation and Usage
Clone the repository.

Run the main detection script using python main.cpp.
